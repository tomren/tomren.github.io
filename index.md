Hi, 

    I am Zhixiong, who are having been work in game industry for dozen years. 

    I mainly develop for game server parts, and also code client modules sometimes(Such as networks, fight, collision, physicis moduels, etcs.). 

    I have been involved in the development and maintain of several published projects. Some games were still in the early stages of prototypes when I joined.

    I am familiar with the business process of the game server, and have developed a variety of game modules, such as attributes, tasks, battles, maps, mall, chat, and the base interfaces of the network and database, etcs. I also developed toolchain for game release process.
